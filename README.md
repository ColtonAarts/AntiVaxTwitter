# AntiVaxTwitter
Tweets used for classification of anti and pro vax

The training files contain all the tweets used to create the classifer that have not been deleted from Twitter. They have the tweet id and the label. -1 is anti vax, 1 is pro vax and 0 is neutral. It is possible for a tweet to be deleted after we collected the text. If this happens there is no way to share the text as it is against Twitters terms and services to share that information. The only info that can be shared is the tweet id.
