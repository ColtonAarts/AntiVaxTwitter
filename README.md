# AntiVaxTwitter
Tweets used for classification of anti and pro vax

There are two .txt files. These files contain all the tweets that were used in creation of the classifiers described in the paper. 
These files are seperated using " ~ ". The format of the files are "TweetID ~ Text ~ Annotation". There are a number of tweets that were deleted off Twitter after collecting them. These are denoted as "DELETED" in the "TweetID" column. Additionaly the file "withoutIds.txt" containes the tweets that were collected at the start of the project before we were saving the tweetIds.
