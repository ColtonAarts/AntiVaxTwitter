~@TheSeamanster @pacifist322 @urbanx_f Wrong again.. The rate of death &amp; encephalitis from vaccines is much higher that injury from natural infections..

~@TheSeamanster @pacifist322 @urbanx_f Its a stat with the cdc link in the top.. Because provaxers are dull at specifics.. Vaccine induced antibodies do not equal immunity.. Refer to the previous science mag link.. Multiple doses also fail.. Thats enough free education for you.. ~ Anti ~ 
~@TheSeamanster @pacifist322 @urbanx_f It becomes severe for them because of poor immune function.. &amp; underlying conditions  the vaccine would cause similar severe effects..
